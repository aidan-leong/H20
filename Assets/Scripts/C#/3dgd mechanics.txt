   current mechanics - general

- game clearing logic which pans camera and lock the last totem to activate last totem within level to show the door opening


   current mechanics - totem  
- evil totem which kills player when hit

   changes to be made - general
- camera is pannable(roblox) and zoomable
- running and walking (not priority)
- health bar (DONE)
- sheild with toggle (DONE)

(spot light inactive then active and window plane moves up w anim)
- enemies that follow player, dies when hit by beam

   changes to be made - totem

- totem material is changed once activated; plus post proccessing


   bug fixes
- weird behav with dualtotem's beams when interacting with pushables w/ mirrors; possibly a reflectbeam() error
(only happens for the +y beam, might not be fixed since shouldnt be able to be encountered in level)
