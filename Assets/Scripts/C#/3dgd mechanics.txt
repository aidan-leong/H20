   current mechanics - general
- player will be able to press e and q near totems to rotate them
- pressure plate that moves down a movable barrier
- game clearing logic which pans camera and lock the last totem to activate last totem within level to show the door opening


   current mechanics - totem  
- evil totem which damages player when hit
- mirror that reflects a totem's beam
- beam activation and deactivation based on if it is hit by another totem



   changes to be made - general
- camera is pannable(roblox) and zoomable 
- running and walking (not priority) (not to be done)
- health bar (DONE)
- sheild with toggle (DONE)
- at the start of the game, there is a lever the player has to interact with that makes the window plane move up and lets the sun light in onto the first totem to light it up 
(spot light inactive then active and window plane moves up w anim)
- enemies that follow player, dies when hit by beam (DONE)
- spawn locations change with checkpoints 

   changes to be made - totem
- new totem that splits beam into 2 (DONE)
- pushable blocks (DONE)
- pushable blocks with mirrors attached (DONE)
- final totem which needs 2 beams to activate (DONE)
- totem material is changed once activated; plus post proccessing (DONE)


   bugs and such
- weird behav with dualtotem's beams when interacting with pushables w/ mirrors; possibly a reflectbeam() error
(only happens for the +y beam, might not be fixed since shouldnt be able to be encounterable in level)

- totem doesnt get updated with deactivation logic until line renderer touched by player??
(only when placed in -4x row in test scene?? might not be a problem)

- sometimes enemies go through objects...
